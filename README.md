# Functions

## Objectives:
```
What are functions and why are they useful
How to create a function
Industry function best practices
What are functions and why we use them:
```
## DRY: Dont, Repeat, Yourself

## Creating a greetings function

### Syntax def name_of_function():
### Each function has a block of code to execute to ideally run one task
### Note: We can assign variables to functions e.g. a = add(5, 7) and a = 12 forever more
```
def greeting(name):
    print(f"Welcome on board {name}, hope you'll enjoy the ride")
# If we execute this program now it would display nothing as we have not called this function

# Syntax to call a function:
greeting('Matt')
```

## Create simple functions

### Creating a function that adds 2 arguments to eachother
```
def add(num1, num2):
    print(num1 + num2)
add(1, 2)
```
```
### Creating a function that subtracts 2 arguments from eachother
def subtract(arg1, arg2):
    print(arg1 - arg2)
subtract(72, 50)
```
## Task

#### Create a function to *
#### Create a function to /
#### Create a function to %
#### Create a function to **
```
def multiply(arg1, arg2):
    return arg1 * arg2
```
```
def divide(arg1, arg2):
    return arg1 / arg2
```
```
def percent(arg1, arg2):
    # To get percentage of arg1 in arg2
    percent = (arg1 / arg2) * 100
    return percent
```
```
def power(arg1, arg2):
    # Where arg1 is the number and arg2 is the power
    return arg1**arg2
```
```
def modulus(arg1, arg2):
    return arg1 % arg2
```

## Can also use return() instead of print() which returns the answer of the function
```
print(multiply(5, 10))
print(divide(33, 11))
print(percent(27, 932))
print(power(3, 3))
print(modulus(19,2))
```
## Best Practices
```
Best practice is to have a small block of code in any function that does 1 job.
Pseudocode where required to explain what the code is doing, usually 1 line.
HINTs: create hints in simple bullet points or pointers
Comments regarding your function results at the end are also acceptable. This means you dont necessarily need huge amounts of pseudocoding
```
